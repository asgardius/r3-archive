# The Red Robot Radio
A simple game using Pygame library (gamepad required).
You control a spaceship with left stick and camera scroll with right stick. Tested with Dualshock 4 on Raspberry Pi and my personal computer with Arch Linux using same gamepad.
If you are using a different gamepad  and/or operating system, you need to edit source code to fit your gamepad commands.
